# README

This documentation describes the computational environment, compilation, runtime execution, and experimental results (i.e. printout verifications of accuracy) of the three [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-zone#:~:text=CUDA%C2%AE%20is%20a%20parallel,harnessing%20the%20power%20of%20GPUs.) exercises.

## Compute environment
The compute environment for this exercise was hosted on [Chameleon CLoud]() on a single compute node with GPU Capabilities.

The compute node hosted a baremetal instance of [Ubuntu 20.04](https://releases.ubuntu.com/focal/) with NVIDIA® [CUDA® Toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit) preinstalled.
