## Guassian Elimination
Suppose that a dense linear equation in the form of $Ax=b$, where $A$ is an $n\times n$ matrix and $b$ is a vector, is solved by Guassian Elimination. The original system of equations is reduced to the form

$$Ux=b$$

where $U$ is an upper triangular matrix of size $n\times n$.
